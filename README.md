# Zac-Jordan-s-Truck-World
Zac &amp; Jordan’s Truck World is a colourful, kid‑friendly HTML5 tapping game designed for 5‑year‑old twins who love trucks. Players help different trucks solve problems on the road — putting out fires, clearing rocks, and helping people — by tapping matching items as the trucks pass by.
